      <p>Traditional business automation follows predetermined rules and workflows. Agentic AI represents a fundamental shiftâ€”systems that can understand context, make decisions, and adapt their behavior based on outcomes. This evolution is transforming how SMEs approach automation.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-4">Understanding Agentic AI</h3>
      <p>Agentic AI systems operate with a degree of autonomy that traditional automation cannot achieve. They can set goals, evaluate multiple approaches, and modify their strategies based on results. This makes them particularly valuable for complex business processes where flexibility and adaptation are essential.</p>

      <p>Unlike rule-based systems that break when encountering unexpected situations, agentic AI can navigate ambiguity and make reasonable decisions in novel circumstances. This capability is especially valuable for SMEs that need to adapt quickly to changing market conditions.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-4">Real-World Applications for SMEs</h3>
      <p>Agentic AI excels in scenarios requiring dynamic decision-making. For customer service, these systems can handle complex inquiries that would confuse traditional chatbots. They understand context, ask clarifying questions, and provide personalized responses that improve over time.</p>

      <p>In inventory management, agentic AI can predict demand fluctuations, automatically adjust reorder points, and even negotiate with suppliers. Welsh retailers using these systems report 25-35% reduction in stockouts while maintaining lower inventory levels.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-4">Implementation Considerations</h3>
      <p>While agentic AI offers significant advantages, implementation requires careful planning. These systems need clear objectives and constraints to operate effectively. SMEs should start with specific use cases where autonomous decision-making provides clear value.</p>

      <p>Training and oversight remain essential. Agentic AI systems learn from experience, but they need guidance to ensure they align with business values and objectives. Regular monitoring and adjustment help optimize performance over time.</p>
