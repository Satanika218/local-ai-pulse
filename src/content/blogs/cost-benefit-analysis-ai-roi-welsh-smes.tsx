      <p>AI investment concerns often prevent SMEs from exploring transformative technologies. However, real-world data from Welsh businesses reveals that AI implementation can deliver substantial returns even for smaller organizations.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-4">Understanding AI Investment Costs</h3>
      <p>AI implementation costs vary significantly based on scope and complexity. Simple automation projects might require £2,000-5,000, while comprehensive AI strategies could range from £10,000-30,000. The key is identifying high-impact opportunities that justify the investment.</p>

      <p>Cloud-based AI services have dramatically reduced entry costs. SMEs can now access sophisticated capabilities through subscription models, avoiding large upfront investments. This democratization makes AI accessible to businesses of all sizes.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-4">Measurable Returns from Welsh SMEs</h3>
      <p>Recent studies of Welsh SMEs reveal consistent patterns in AI ROI. Customer service automation typically delivers 40-60% reduction in response times while handling 70% of routine inquiries automatically. This translates to significant labor cost savings and improved customer satisfaction.</p>

      <p>Process automation generates even more impressive returns. One Cardiff manufacturer automated their order processing, reducing processing time from 2 hours to 15 minutes per order. With 50 orders weekly, this saves 83 hours monthly—equivalent to £1,660 in labor costs at £20/hour.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-4">Implementation Timeline Expectations</h3>
      <p>Most SME AI projects follow predictable timelines. Assessment and planning typically require 2-4 weeks. Implementation ranges from 4-12 weeks depending on complexity. Training and optimization add another 4-8 weeks.</p>

      <p>Simple automation projects can show results within 3 months. More sophisticated AI implementations might require 6-9 months to demonstrate full ROI. However, partial benefits often appear much earlier in the process.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-4">Calculating Your Potential ROI</h3>
      <p>To estimate your AI ROI, identify processes consuming significant time or generating frequent errors. Calculate current costs including labor, materials, and opportunity costs. Compare these to projected costs after AI implementation.</p>

      <p>Don't overlook intangible benefits like improved accuracy, faster response times, and enhanced customer satisfaction. These often translate to measurable business value over time.</p>
