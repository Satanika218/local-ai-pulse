  title: 'Building Digital Skills in Rural Communities: A Practical Framework',
  excerpt: 'Rural areas face unique challenges in developing digital skills. This framework provides practical strategies for building tech capabilities in communities where traditional training resources may be limited.',

      <p>Rural communities across Wales and the border counties face distinct challenges in developing digital skills. Limited access to training resources, fewer networking opportunities, and connectivity issues create barriers that urban areas don't experience. However, these challenges also present opportunities for innovative approaches to skill development.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-4">Understanding Rural Skill Gaps</h3>
      <p>Rural skill gaps often differ from urban patterns. While basic digital literacy may be adequate, advanced skills like data analysis, automation, and AI implementation are less common. Geographic isolation limits access to specialized training and professional development opportunities.</p>

      <p>Demographic factors also play a role. Rural populations tend to be older on average, creating different learning preferences and technology comfort levels. Younger residents may leave for urban opportunities, creating brain drain that further reduces local expertise.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-4">Practical Framework Components</h3>
      <p>Successful rural digital skills programs share common elements. They leverage local networks and trusted community institutions for delivery. They provide hands-on, practical training that addresses immediate business needs rather than abstract concepts.</p>

      <p>Peer learning models work particularly well in rural settings. Local business owners teaching other business owners creates trust and relevance that external trainers might struggle to achieve. This approach also builds sustainable local expertise.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-4">Implementation Strategies</h3>
      <p>Start with assessment to understand current capabilities and specific needs. Survey local businesses to identify common challenges and opportunities. This information helps prioritize training topics and delivery methods.</p>

      <p>Partner with existing community organizations like chambers of commerce, business associations, and educational institutions. These partnerships provide credibility and access to established networks.</p>
