      <p>AI technology creates new cybersecurity challenges for businesses even as it offers powerful defensive capabilities. Understanding these evolving threats is essential for Welsh SMEs implementing AI solutions while maintaining security and customer trust.</p>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-4">AI-Powered Threats</h3>
<p>Cybercriminals increasingly use AI to automate and enhance attacks. AI-generated phishing emails are more convincing and personalized, making them harder to detect. Traditional security awareness training may not prepare employees for these sophisticated threats.</p>

<p>Deepfake technology can create convincing audio or video impersonations of business leaders, potentially tricking employees into revealing sensitive information or authorizing fraudulent transactions. These attacks are particularly dangerous because they exploit trust in familiar voices or faces.</p>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-4">Defensive AI Applications</h3>
<p>AI-powered security systems can detect anomalies and potential threats faster than traditional methods. These systems analyze network traffic patterns, user behavior, and system logs to identify suspicious activities that might indicate cyberattacks.</p>

<p>Automated threat detection helps smaller businesses access enterprise-grade security capabilities. Cloud-based security services use AI to protect multiple businesses simultaneously, making advanced protection affordable for SMEs.</p>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-4">Protecting AI Systems</h3>
<p>AI implementations themselves need protection from cyber threats. Training data poisoning attacks can corrupt AI models, causing them to make incorrect decisions or behave maliciously. Regular model validation and secure data handling practices are essential.</p>

<p>Model theft represents another concern, where attackers attempt to steal proprietary AI models or the data used to train them. This intellectual property theft can compromise competitive advantages and reveal sensitive business information.</p>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-4">Best Practices for SMEs</h3>
<p>Implement multi-factor authentication for all business systems, particularly those involving financial transactions or sensitive data. This provides additional protection even if passwords are compromised through AI-enhanced attacks.</p>

<p>Regular security awareness training should address AI-powered threats. Employees need to understand that sophisticated attacks may appear to come from trusted sources and should be verified through independent channels.</p>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-4">Balancing Security and Innovation</h3>
<p>Security measures should enable rather than hinder AI adoption. Work with security professionals who understand both AI technology and business requirements to develop appropriate protections without blocking beneficial implementations.</p>

<p>Regular security assessments help identify vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them. These assessments should specifically evaluate AI-related risks and ensure that security measures evolve alongside AI capabilities.</p>
