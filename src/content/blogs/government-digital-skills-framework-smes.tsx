      <p>The UK government's Essential Digital Skills Framework identifies 20 core competencies that workers need to thrive in the modern workplace. But if you're running a small business in Powys, Shropshire, or Herefordshire, you might be wondering: what does this actually mean for me?</p>

      <p>Let's cut through the policy language and explore what these skills look like in practice, why they matter, and how to develop them in your team—with real examples from businesses just like yours.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-4">Why This Matters Now</h3>

      <p>Here's the reality: 72% of UK SMEs lack the government's suggested digital skills. This isn't just a statistic—it's a competitive disadvantage that's costing businesses money, opportunities, and growth.</p>

      <p>But here's the opportunity: businesses that systematically develop these skills see average productivity improvements of 40-60%, error reductions of 50-70%, and capacity increases of 20-40%. The investment in skills development typically pays for itself within 6-9 months.</p>
