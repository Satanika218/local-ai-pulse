      <p>Digital transformation can feel abstract until you see it in action. That's why we're sharing real stories from Welsh SMEs that have successfully navigated the journey. These aren't theoretical case studies—they're actual businesses in Wales and the border counties that have transformed their operations through smart technology adoption.</p>

      <p>Each story offers lessons, inspiration, and practical insights you can apply to your own business.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-4">Story 1: From Paper to Profit - Construction Company, Newtown</h3>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-lime mt-4 mb-3">The Starting Point</h4>
      <p>A family-run construction company with 12 employees was drowning in paperwork. Quotes, invoices, timesheets, project documentation—everything was manual. The owner spent 15-20 hours per week on administration, time that should have been spent on business development or with family.</p>

      <p><strong>Key Challenges:</strong></p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 text-brand-silver">
        <li>Invoicing delays leading to cash flow problems</li>
        <li>Lost paperwork causing disputes</li>
        <li>Difficulty tracking project profitability</li>
        <li>No time for business growth</li>
        <li>Owner burnout</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-lime mt-4 mb-3">The Transformation</h4>
      <p><strong>Phase 1 (Month 1-2):</strong> Automated invoicing and payment tracking</p>
      <p><strong>Phase 2 (Month 3-4):</strong> Digital project management and timesheets</p>
      <p><strong>Phase 3 (Month 5-6):</strong> Automated quoting and document management</p>

      <p><strong>Investment:</strong> £5,000 setup, £800/month ongoing = £14,600 first year</p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-lime mt-4 mb-3">The Results (After 12 Months)</h4>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 text-brand-silver">
        <li>Admin time reduced from 20 hours/week to 5 hours/week</li>
        <li>Get paid 45% faster (improved cash flow by £25,000)</li>
        <li>Zero lost paperwork or disputes</li>
        <li>Project profitability visible in real-time</li>
        <li>Took on 30% more projects without additional admin staff</li>
        <li>Owner's work-life balance dramatically improved</li>
        <li>Additional revenue: £85,000</li>
        <li>ROI: 480%</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Owner's Reflection:</strong> "I used to spend evenings and weekends doing paperwork. Now I spend them with my family. The system paid for itself in saved time alone, but the business growth has been transformative. We're more profitable, more organized, and I'm actually enjoying running the business again."</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-4">Story 2: Tourist Destination to Digital Leader - Tourism Business, Brecon</h3>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-lime mt-4 mb-3">The Starting Point</h4>
      <p>A boutique hotel was losing bookings to larger chains with sophisticated online systems. They couldn't afford 24/7 staff but needed to compete. Website traffic was good, but conversion was poor.</p>

      <p><strong>Key Challenges:</strong></p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 text-brand-silver">
        <li>Missing after-hours bookings</li>
        <li>Slow response to inquiries</li>
        <li>Manual booking process prone to errors</li>
        <li>Limited marketing capacity</li>
        <li>Competing with larger, better-resourced businesses</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-lime mt-4 mb-3">The Transformation</h4>
      <p><strong>Phase 1 (Month 1-2):</strong> AI customer service and booking system</p>
      <p><strong>Phase 2 (Month 3-4):</strong> Automated marketing and email campaigns</p>
      <p><strong>Phase 3 (Month 5-6):</strong> Predictive analytics for pricing and capacity</p>

      <p><strong>Investment:</strong> £4,000 setup, £600/month ongoing = £11,200 first year</p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-lime mt-4 mb-3">The Results (After 12 Months)</h4>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 text-brand-silver">
        <li>Captured £40,000 in after-hours bookings</li>
        <li>Response time: 30 seconds vs 12+ hours</li>
        <li>Booking errors eliminated</li>
        <li>Marketing engagement up 200%</li>
        <li>Occupancy rate increased from 65% to 82%</li>
        <li>TripAdvisor rating improved from 4.2 to 4.7</li>
        <li>Additional revenue: £95,000</li>
        <li>ROI: 748%</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Owner's Reflection:</strong> "We were competing with chains that had entire teams dedicated to online bookings. Now our AI system works 24/7, never takes a day off, and provides better service than many human teams. We've gone from struggling to compete to leading our market segment."</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-4">Story 3: Retail Renaissance - Farm Shop, Herefordshire</h3>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-lime mt-4 mb-3">The Starting Point</h4>
      <p>A farm shop was struggling to compete with supermarkets. They had great products but limited marketing budget, unpredictable foot traffic, and inventory challenges with perishable goods.</p>

      <p><strong>Key Challenges:</strong></p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 text-brand-silver">
        <li>High waste on perishable products</li>
        <li>Unpredictable customer traffic</li>
        <li>Limited online presence</li>
        <li>Competing with supermarket convenience</li>
        <li>Tight margins</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-lime mt-4 mb-3">The Transformation</h4>

      <p><strong>Investment:</strong> £6,000 setup, £700/month ongoing = £14,400 first year</p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-lime mt-4 mb-3">The Results (After 12 Months)</h4>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 text-brand-silver">

        <li>ROI: 504%</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Owner's Reflection:</strong> "We were competing on price with supermarkets and losing. Now we compete on quality, freshness, and local connection—and we're winning. Technology helped us tell our story to more people and operate more efficiently. We're not just surviving—we're thriving."</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-4">Story 4: Professional Services Transformation - Accounting Firm, Shrewsbury</h3>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-lime mt-4 mb-3">The Starting Point</h4>
      <p>A small accounting firm was turning away clients because they couldn't handle more work without hiring. But hiring was expensive and risky. They needed to grow capacity without proportionally increasing costs.</p>

      <p><strong>Key Challenges:</strong></p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 text-brand-silver">
        <li>Capacity constraints limiting growth</li>
        <li>Manual document processing time-consuming</li>
        <li>Client communication reactive rather than proactive</li>
        <li>Difficulty competing with larger firms</li>
        <li>Staff working long hours</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-lime mt-4 mb-3">The Transformation</h4>
      <p><strong>Phase 1 (Month 1-2):</strong> Automated document processing</p>
      <p><strong>Phase 2 (Month 3-4):</strong> Client communication and scheduling system</p>
      <p><strong>Phase 3 (Month 5-6):</strong> AI-assisted analysis and reporting</p>

      <p><strong>Investment:</strong> £8,000 setup, £900/month ongoing = £18,800 first year</p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-lime mt-4 mb-3">The Results (After 12 Months)</h4>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 text-brand-silver">
        <li>Capacity increased 40% without new hires</li>
        <li>Document processing 70% faster</li>
        <li>Client satisfaction improved significantly</li>
        <li>Staff working normal hours (better work-life balance)</li>

        <li>ROI: 565%</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Owner's Reflection:</strong> "We were at a crossroads: hire more people (expensive and risky) or turn away business (limiting growth). Technology gave us a third option: grow smarter, not just bigger. We're now serving more clients, providing better service, and our team is happier because they're doing more interesting work."</p>
