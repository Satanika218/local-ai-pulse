      <p>In the race to digital transformation, legacy systems often act as anchors, slowing progress and limiting innovation. Many UK SMEs rely on outdated systems that don&apos;t integrate well with newer technologies, creating inefficient processes and barriers to growth.</p>
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-4">Are You Trapped by Legacy Technology?</h3>
      <p>Consider these questions:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 text-brand-silver">
        <li>Do your employees waste time on manual workarounds because your systems don&apos;t work together?</li>
        <li>Are you unable to implement new technologies because they won&apos;t connect with your existing systems?</li>
        <li>Do you worry about the security and reliability of aging software or hardware?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The statistics highlight how widespread this challenge is: 74% of UK businesses report that legacy systems are holding back their digital transformation efforts, while 60% of SMEs cite integration issues as a major barrier to adopting new technologies.</p>
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-4">The Hidden Costs of Legacy Systems</h3>
      <p>While the upfront cost of replacing legacy systems can seem prohibitive, continuing to rely on outdated technology often incurs significant hidden costs:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 text-brand-silver">
        <li><strong>Maintenance Expenses</strong>: Older systems typically require more maintenance and support, often from specialists who charge premium rates for increasingly rare skills.</li>
        <li><strong>Productivity Losses</strong>: Manual workarounds and duplicate data entry waste employee time and introduce errors.</li>
        <li><strong>Missed Opportunities</strong>: Legacy systems limit your ability to adopt new technologies and business models that could drive growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities</strong>: Outdated systems often lack modern security features and may no longer receive security updates.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Research by McKinsey suggests that companies that successfully modernize their legacy systems can reduce their IT costs by up to 30% while significantly improving business agility.</p>
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-4">Regional Challenges</h3>
      <p>For businesses in Wales and the border counties, legacy system challenges often have distinct regional and industry dimensions.</p>
      <p>Manufacturing businesses in Shropshire frequently rely on specialized production systems that were implemented years or even decades ago. The Manufacturing Technology Centre reports that 62% of small manufacturers in the region are operating with systems more than 10 years old.</p>
      <p>Agricultural businesses in Powys and Herefordshire may use sector-specific legacy systems for operations like livestock management or crop planning. According to Farming Connect, 58% of farms in Wales are using outdated management software that limits their ability to implement precision agriculture technologies.</p>
      <p>Tourism businesses in North Wales might struggle with outdated booking and property management systems. Visit Wales research indicates that 47% of accommodation providers in the region are using booking systems that don&apos;t integrate with modern online travel platforms.</p>

        &quot;We thought we&apos;d need to replace our entire production management system, which would have been hugely disruptive,&quot; says Thomas Williams, operations manager at a manufacturing business in Ludlow. &quot;11th Temple created an integration layer that connected our old system with our new inventory management software. We&apos;ve improved efficiency without the risk and cost of a complete system replacement.&quot;
