  title: 'Data Privacy and AI: Navigating GDPR Compliance for Welsh Businesses',
  excerpt: 'AI implementation must respect data privacy regulations. This guide helps Welsh businesses understand GDPR requirements when deploying AI solutions and how to maintain compliance.',

    <>
      <p>AI implementation offers tremendous benefits for Welsh businesses, but it must be balanced with data privacy obligations. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to AI systems processing personal data, creating specific compliance requirements that businesses must understand.</p>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-4">Understanding AI and GDPR Intersection</h3>
<p>AI systems often process personal data, whether training machine learning models or making predictions about individuals. This processing falls under GDPR requirements, meaning businesses must have lawful bases for processing and must respect individual rights.</p>

<p>Key considerations include data minimization (only collecting necessary data), purpose limitation (using data only for specified purposes), and storage limitation (not keeping data longer than necessary). AI systems must be designed with these principles in mind from the outset.</p>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-4">Practical Compliance Steps</h3>
<p>Conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) before implementing AI systems that process personal data. These assessments identify privacy risks and document mitigation measures. Welsh businesses implementing customer-facing AI should complete this process.</p>

p>Ensure transparency by clearly informing individuals when AI systems process their data. Privacy notices should explain what data is collected, how it's used, and what rights individuals have. This is particularly important for AI customer service systems.</p>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-4">Rights and Remedies</h3>
<p>Individuals have specific rights under GDPR that apply to AI processing. These include the right to access (knowing what data is held), rectification (correcting inaccurate data), and erasure (having data deleted in certain circumstances).</p>

<p>The right to explanation is particularly relevant for AI systems. Individuals can request meaningful information about automated decision-making processes that significantly affect them. Businesses must be able to explain how their AI systems reach decisions.</p>
